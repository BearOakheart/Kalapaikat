    <p>No matter how old you are, or how active you are, extra curricular activities and hobbies are essential for individuality and happiness. The great thing about hobbies is that you can pick whichever one, and however many, you want. What’s even greater is that there are a select few hobbies that you can continue to enjoy even when you’ve reached retirement bliss – gardening, collecting (coins, stamps, Coca-Cola products, etc.), golf, and last but certainly not least – fishing!</p>
    <p>Nowadays, you know you’ve “made it” in terms of popularity when a reality television show is produced. Low and behold, there are several reality shows about fishing, the most popular being Deadliest Catch of course, which portrays the extreme life of crab fishermen.</p>
    <p>That’s not the only proof of fishing’s “extreme” popularity either! Fishing has been married with another traditional water hobby – kayaking. Those with a passion for the great outdoors and a craving for new adventures can participate in extreme kayak fishing tournaments.</p>
    <p>Clearly, the popularity of this favorite pastime is not to be reckoned with. What started out as a means to survive and capture food, has transformed into one of the most adored outdoor hobbies in the United States, and for good reason!</p>
    <p>If you are one of the few that has yet to “catch” this fishing fever, then it’s probably about time you cast out your line and get a taste of that salty air. As an added benefit to newbies, depending on your geographical location and personal preferences, there are several different types of fishing to choose from.</p>
    <ul>
<li><strong>Freshwater vs. Saltwater</strong> – As can be assumed by the name, freshwater fishing is carried out in freshwater lakes and ponds, and the fish are not eaten. Saltwater fishing takes place in the ocean and inlets, and often times ends with a tasty catch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fly Fishing</strong> – This type of fishing earned its name because of the type of bait this is used, which “flies” and imitates insects on the water. Trout is commonly caught via fly fishing, which is typically practiced in knee-deep waters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netting</strong> – As the name suggests, this particular kind of fishing activity is done using a net, and it usually requires more than one person in order to be effective.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Shore vs. Offshore</strong> – These are two of the most common fishing terms thrown around but the names are quite simple. On shore fishing is practiced from land, on the coastal shores. Offshore fishing requires a boat and implies that you are out in open waters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In addition to the variety that fishing offers, there are numerous other benefits that contribute to its popularity. Some of these benefits include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasonal</strong> – As long as you wear the appropriate clothing and are not afraid of extreme cold or heat, then you can participate in fishing activities all year long. Even in the northern states where lakes freeze over, people still fish.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relaxation</strong> – One of the most common reasons why people choose to fish is because it relieves stress, provides relaxation, and just makes them happy. That is a selling point in itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent or Shared</strong> – Whether you are someone that cherishes alone time, or enjoys the company of others, you can still fish. Better yet, fishing is an excellent activity for the whole family to participate in together.</li>
</ul>
